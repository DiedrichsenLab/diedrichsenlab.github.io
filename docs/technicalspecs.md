## Hand devices used for behavioural/imaging experiments

### Parts list for hand device
- Force transducers (Honeywell FSG15N1A) [spec sheet](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/honeywell-sensing-and-productivity-solutions/FSG15N1A/480-2621-5-ND/1248956)
- Plastic connectors for connecting force transducers outputs to amplifier (400 Series Buccaneer) [spec sheet](https://www.alliedelec.com/m/d/3b2e791d6f12f84357e18c8912681635.pdf). Wiring diagram for connectors can be found [here](/assets/fingerboxes/connectors.zip).

### Parts list for amplifier
- Printed circuit board for amplifier circuit. Connection diagrams and files for PCB fabrication can be found [here](/assets/fingerboxes/circuit_schematics.zip).
- Inputs from the force transducers are amplified and fed to a data acquisition card. We use a PCI sensoarray (S626), [spec sheet](http://www.sensoray.com/products/626.htm), card for this. The wiring diagram for connecting force transducer inputs to the breakout-box connecting to the S626 is shown below: ![stimulator box wiring](/assets/fingerboxes/stimBox_wiring.jpg)
