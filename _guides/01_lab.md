## Lab Meeting Formats

### Presentations
- Lab members usually practice upcoming presentations (talks or posters) the week before their events. It is the job of the rest of the lab to provide constructive feedback to the presenter. Feedback can be given during or after the presentation.

- Always ask questions if something is not clear. Lab meetings are meant to help the presenter but also introduce new ideas to lab members.

- If you are presenting, make sure to have your setup fully ready before the start of the lab meeting. This includes setting up hybrid presentations if needed.

### Tutorials/workshops
- We often give tutorials of specific topics. These should be relevant to at least a number of lab members. Even if they are not immediately relevant to your work, they are a great way to learn something new. If you think there is a specific topic we should have a tutorial on, please don't hesitate to suggest the topic. We will then find somebody who can run the tutorial. 

### Journal clubs
- A team member selects a scientific article for a group discussion. The presenter summarizes the article's objectives, mthods and results followed by a group discussion.
- Participation requires raeding the selected article in advance and having questions and comments ready for the discussion.
